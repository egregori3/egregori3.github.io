<p>
Professional instructor at <b>Georgia Tech (graduate operating systems)</b> and <b>Southern New Hampshire University (C++/OOP)</b>, I have five years of experience teaching graduate and undergraduate students. At Freescale, I created training material on Ethernet, USB, and Linux and presented the material throughout the US. Teaching allows me to comprehensively investigate and learn the subjects beyond what I would need when doing software development.  
</p>
<p>
Software manager experienced at building teams of both experienced and fresh engineers. At <b>Analog Devices</b>, I managed a group of four engineers developing custom software per customer specifications. After graduating with my master’s in 2019, I worked full-time (under an 18-month grant) as a <b>research scientist at Georgia Tech</b>, managing a team of seven grad students researching artificial intelligence in the classroom (<a href="https://dilab.gatech.edu/a-suite-of-online-learning-tools/">the project is called Jill Watson</a>). 
</p>
<p>
Self-starter with <b>17 years of experience working remotely</b> and a proven history of shipping firmware to internal and external customers.  My curiosity drives me to take on challenges; I always seek learning opportunities. For example, I developed a programming language called <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/robotsee-users?pli=1">RobotSee </a>to help kids learn to program and various <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/seeprogrammer/videos">robots</a> to demonstrate the utility of the language. Then, at Freescale, I created a robot for promoting the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexknapp/2011/05/03/freescale-semiconductor-wants-you-to-learn-how-to-program-robots/?sh=2de0a99c5ec2">i.MX family and accelerometers</a>. My work on RobotSee led me to do an in-depth analysis<b> </b>of embedded computer vision, including <b>3D</b><b> </b>and<b> </b><b>LIDAR</b>. As an <b>embedded vision software engineer </b>at BDTI, I developed computer vision algorithms using <a href="https://www.bdti.com/MyBDTI/pubs%3ABDTI_ESCSV_2012_Intro_Computer_Vision.pdf">OpenCV</a> and implemented them on various <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jD_99_oPA">ARM processors</a>. As a master’s student at Georgia Tech, I took classes in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTRpWi_nlrQ">computer vision and algorithm development</a> (<b>Harris, SIFT, RANSAC, </b><b>optical flow</b><b>, and </b><b>particle filters</b>).
